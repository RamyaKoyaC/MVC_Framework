In MVC, we don not have View State. A view state is that it stores the value of the control after post-back. It is easy to implement but has secruity issues. 

# Must be used only when there is less amount of data

# Use for data that doesn't need any security

# Can anytime enable or disable the feature

# Encryption of the data can also be done right away

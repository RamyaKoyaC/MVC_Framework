There are two built-in view engines in MVC: 

# Razor Engine --> Compact syntax, advanced, TDD, secure
# ASPX Engine (Active Server Page eXtendable) - quite old 

Also views can be written in two ways, 

1. Strongly Typed --> Better, prior knowledge that data is being passed
2. Dynamically Typed Views --> Sometimes may lead to runtime errors
